My solutions for Programming Principles and Practice by Bjarne Stroustrup (3rd edition)

# Jan 10, 2024 update:
I completed Part II of Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ over winter break, working through all drills and approximately 25% of the exercises. Chapter 10 is missing due to an unfortunate use of rm in the shell.

## Learning outcomes

### Systems and I/O (Chapter 9)
The deep dive into streams helped me understand:
- C++ I/O fundamentals
- Data flow between sources and sinks
- Multiple layers of abstraction in system I/O

### Object-oriented programming foundations (Chapters 10-12)
Part II's focus on object-oriented programming significantly deepened my understanding of core OOP concepts, including:
- Inheritance and derived classes
- Abstract classes and virtual functions
- Encapsulation and access control
- Mutability
- Constructor implementation in derived classes

### Applied object-oriented design (Chapters 13-14)
The final chapters demonstrated practical applications of OOP principles through:
- Graph construction and manipulation (Chapter 13)
- GUI development from fundamental objects (Chapter 14)
